    "\n",
    "### The Library Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a smart assistant who can answer questions. There are two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧠 Regular AI (like ChatGPT without RAG):**\n",
    "- Like a person who memorized a lot of information years ago\n",
    "- Can answer from memory, but might forget details or make things up\n",
    "- Doesn't know about new information after their training\n",
    "- Sometimes confidently gives wrong answers (called \"hallucinations\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**📚 RAG AI (like our NIST Agent):**\n",
    "- Like a person with access to a huge library\n",
    "- First searches the library for relevant books\n",
    "- Reads the actual pages before answering\n",
    "- Shows you which books they used (citations)\n",
    "- Always bases answers on real documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking Down R-A-G:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **R - Retrieval**: Find relevant documents (like searching in a library)\n",
    "2. **A - Augmented**: Enhanced with real information (like reading the books)\n",
    "3. **G - Generation**: Create an answer using what was found (like writing a summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Benefit:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without RAG:**\n",
    "> \"I think NIST recommends changing passwords every 90 days...\" ❌ (Outdated/Wrong)\n",
    "\n",
    "**With RAG:**\n",
    "> \"According to NIST SP 800-63B, passwords should NOT be changed regularly without reason. Source: NIST Digital Identity Guidelines, page 15\" ✅ (Accurate with proof)"

    "### Key Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Regular AI | RAG AI |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| **Accuracy** | Based on old training | Based on current documents |\n",
    "| **Citations** | No sources | Shows exact sources |\n",
    "| **Updates** | Needs retraining | Updates with new docs |\n",
    "| **Hallucinations** | Common | Minimal (tied to real data) |\n",
    "| **Trustworthiness** | Hard to verify | Easy to verify sources |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perfect Use Cases for RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Legal/Compliance** - Need exact references\n",
    "✅ **Technical Documentation** - Need accurate procedures\n",
    "✅ **Research** - Need to cite sources\n",
    "✅ **Enterprise Knowledge** - Search company documents\n",
    "✅ **Medical/Scientific** - Need verified information\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Our NIST RAG Agent Helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **596 NIST documents** with **530,000+ examples**\n",
    "- Covers all major frameworks: CSF 2.0, Zero Trust, 800-53, etc.\n",
    "- Always provides citations\n",
    "- Understands context from previous questions\n",
    "- Falls back to web search if needed"

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Your Question → Agent → Tools → AI Response → You\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1️⃣ You Ask a Question**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"What are the access control requirements?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2️⃣ Question is Converted to Numbers (Embeddings)**\n",
    "- Your text becomes a mathematical representation\n",
    "- Think of it like a GPS coordinate for your question\n",
    "- Similar questions get similar \"coordinates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**3️⃣ Find Similar Documents (Vector Search)**\n",
    "- Agent searches through 596 NIST documents\n",
    "- Finds the 5 most relevant sections\n",
    "- Like Google search, but for NIST docs only\n",
    "\n",
    "**4️⃣ AI Reads & Understands**\n",
    "- GPT-4 reads the found documents\n",
    "- Combines information from multiple sources\n",
    "- Maintains conversation context\n",
    "\n",
    "**5️⃣ Generate Response with Citations**\n",
    "- Creates a clear answer in natural language\n",
    "- Includes which documents were used\n",
    "- Shows control IDs and links\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Agent's Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 **RAG Search Tool** - Primary search through NIST documents\n",
    "📋 **Control Lookup** - Direct lookup of control IDs (like AC-2, AU-6)\n",
    "📖 **Document Search** - Searches titles and metadata\n",
    "🌐 **Web Search** - Fallback for very new or external info\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smart Decision Making:\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent automatically chooses the best tool:\n",
    "- \"Explain AC-2\" → Uses Control Lookup (fastest)\n",
    "- \"What is access control?\" → Uses RAG Search (most comprehensive)\n",
    "- \"Latest NIST news\" → Uses Web Search (most current)"

    "\n",
    "### Writing Good Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ DO:\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ **Be specific**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"What are NIST's password requirements in SP 800-63B?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ **Use control IDs when known**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"Explain AC-2 and its enhancements\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ **Use same session_id for related questions**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "agent.query(\"What is encryption?\", session_id=\"crypto_session\")\n",
    "agent.query(\"Which algorithms does NIST recommend?\", session_id=\"crypto_session\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ **Ask for implementation guidance**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"How do I implement multi-factor authentication per NIST guidelines?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ DON'T:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Too vague**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"Tell me about security\"  # Too broad\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Multiple unrelated questions at once**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"What is AC-2 and also tell me about firewalls and quantum computing?\"  # Split into separate queries\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Questions outside NIST scope**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"What does ISO 27001 say?\"  # Agent specializes in NIST\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use different session IDs for different topics:**"

    "### Performance Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. First query is slower** (initializes tools)\n",
    "   - Subsequent queries are faster\n",
    "   - Keep agent instance alive for multiple queries\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Specific queries are faster**\n",
    "   - \"Explain AC-2\" → Direct control lookup\n",
    "   - \"Tell me about access control\" → Full RAG search\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Limit follow-up depth**\n",
    "   - After 10-15 exchanges, start new session\n",
    "   - Long histories can slow response time\n",
